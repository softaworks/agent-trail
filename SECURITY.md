# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you believe you found a security issue, please report it privately.

- Preferred: open a GitHub Security Advisory (if enabled for the repository)
- Otherwise: contact the maintainers via GitHub (create an issue asking for a private channel)

Please include:

- A clear description of the issue and impact
- Steps to reproduce (proof-of-concept if possible)
- Any relevant logs or screenshots

## Supported Versions

Only the `main` branch is supported with security updates at the moment.
